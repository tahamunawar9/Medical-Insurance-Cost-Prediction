# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs for individuals based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, and region. The project utilizes data science techniques including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and linear regression modeling.

# Project Overview
Medical insurance costs can vary significantly based on individual characteristics and lifestyle factors. Understanding the drivers behind these costs can be valuable for insurance companies in pricing their policies and for individuals in planning for healthcare expenses. This project uses a dataset containing information about individuals, including their demographic information and medical insurance costs, to build a predictive model for insurance costs.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Python
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
seaborn: Data visualization
matplotlib: Data visualization
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for implementing linear regression model
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment for data analysis and modeling
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

age: Age of the individual
sex: Gender of the individual (male/female)
bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual
children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
smoker: Smoking status of the individual (yes/no)
region: Geographic region of the individual (e.g., southwest, southeast, northwest, northeast)
charges: Medical insurance costs for the individual
Project Workflow
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identify potential patterns.
Data Visualization: Visualize key relationships and distributions using seaborn and matplotlib to better understand the data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transformations of existing features to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implement a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict medical insurance costs based on the input features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Prediction: Make predictions on new data to estimate medical insurance costs for individuals.
# Results
The linear regression model achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting medical insurance costs based on the input features. Further analysis of the model's performance and potential areas for improvement can be explored.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to predict medical insurance costs for individuals. By leveraging machine learning models, insurance companies can better understand the factors influencing insurance costs and individuals can make informed decisions about their healthcare expenses.
